# Webflix Project

This repository was created as part of a Git course to learn fundamental Git operations and version control concepts. It simulates a basic content management system for a video streaming service.

## Project Contents

- `contents.md` - Table of contents for the project
- `titles.md` - List of available movies
- `quotes/` - Directory containing movie quotes
  - `star_wars.md` - Star Wars quotes
  - `dune.md` - Dune quotes

## Git Concepts Demonstrated

Through this project, I practiced:

- Repository initialization and setup
- Basic Git operations (add, commit, status)
- Branch creation and management
- Merging changes and handling conflicts
- Working with remote repositories
- Git configurations and .gitignore usage

## Purpose

While this isn't a functional video streaming service, it served as a practical example for learning Git fundamentals. The project provided hands-on experience with version control in a content management context.
